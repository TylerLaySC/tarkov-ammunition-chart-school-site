        <p class="purpose-text">Have you ever fought someone in a raid, dumping your
            entire magazine of ammuntion into the opponent, but
            they are still standing? Has the video on the right ever 
            felt like you? Well thatâ€™s the point of this
            website, to try and stop it from happening again.</p>
        <p class="purpose-text">
            This site is mostly targeted towards newer players
            who are still getting their footing right with the
            game. Learning which ammo is best to take early
            makes for better in raid and out of raid
            decisions. Knowing what ammunition is good can
            help you save and gain more rubles. </p>
